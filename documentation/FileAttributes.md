# File attributes
Attributes to analyse from malicious and benign files

## PE (Portable executable)
The file format used in Microsoft Windows which acts as a container that stores programs and their resources


|Main Features|
|---|
|DOS Header: Contains information about the MS-DOS stub program involved in DOS environment execution, which helps the operating system understand how to load and execute the program|
|NT Header: Contains the File Headers and Optional Headers|
|File Headers: Contains its signature, program layout and target system|
|Optional Headers: Contains metadata of the file|
|Section Headers: Specify the location and size of the various sections in the file|
|Sections (Data): Contains the actual executable code and data for the program|
|Resources: Contains the various resources used by the program|
|Import/Export Table: Contains information about the external functions and libraries that the program uses, as well as the functions and symbols that the program exports to other programs|

The above features can be analysed for any anomalous values or data from known malicious sources, this can also help to indicate if the code has been obfuscated which can be a common sign of malware. This basic scanning of the attributes can be used to flag any initial signs of malware, but may not be reliable enough to use alone.

The attributes can be passed into a machine learning model, which will be trained on a large dataset of both malicious and benign files, which can more accurately analyse the patterns between attributes and will provide a more accurate result in combination with the flags.


## MD5 Hashing
The hash value is a fixed-sized, unique value that represents the input data which is the file in our case.

This technique can be used to compare known malware hashes with the hash value of a given file to determine if it has already been detected or contains similarities by cross-referencing the information with a database of saved hashes. While this can be effective, it becomes less reliable when the code has been obfuscated - altered to be more difficult to analyse - as the hash values will differ from the original.

Local sensitivity hashing (LSH) can be implemented to overcome obfuscation. This involves mapping the high-dimensional hash values into a lower dimension, simplifying the hash values and reducing the number of characteristics that need to be analysed. The resulting values can then be compared with other hashes and grouped into ‘buckets’ (groups) based on similarities and the probability of belonging to a specific category, such as malicious or benign in our case. This can be done through algorithms or machine learning models for more accurate classifications, as this method is more effective than simple hash comparison.

It can be achieved by combining a random forest classifier and a locality sensitive hashing algorithm. The random forest classifier is trained on a large dataset of both malicious and benign files, which can more accurately analyse the patterns between attributes and will provide a more accurate result in combination with the flags. The locality sensitive hashing algorithm is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data, which can be used to group similar files together and determine the probability of a file being malicious or benign based on the group it belongs to.
