# File attributes
Attributes to analyse from malicious and benign files

## PE (Portable executable)
The file format used in Microsoft Windows which acts as a container that stores programs and their resources


|Main Features|
|---|
|DOS Header: Contains information about the MS-DOS stub program involved in DOS environment execution, which helps the operating system understand how to load and execute the program|
|NT Header: Contains the File Headers and Optional Headers|
|File Headers: Contains its signature, program layout and target system|
|Optional Headers: Contains metadata of the file|
|Section Headers: Specify the location and size of the various sections in the file|
|Sections (Data): Contains the actual executable code and data for the program|
|Resources: Contains the various resources used by the program|
|Import/Export Table: Contains information about the external functions and libraries that the program uses, as well as the functions and symbols that the program exports to other programs|

The above features can be analysed for any anomalous values or data from known malicious sources, this can also help to indicate if the code has been obfuscated which can be a common sign of malware. This basic scanning of the attributes can be used to flag any initial signs of malware, but may not be reliable enough to use alone.

The attributes can be passed into a machine learning model, which will be trained on a large dataset of both malicious and benign files, which can more accurately analyse the patterns between attributes and will provide a more accurate result in combination with the flags.
